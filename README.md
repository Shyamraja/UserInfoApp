<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This application is a part of assignment which can show Information of users in Card in Home page. From more info button detail info of users is shown in modal page.
## Built With

This application shows JSON data with react components . The major technologies that are used to develop projects are as follows

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/)


## Prerequisites

In order to run this, you should have node in your device. You can first create react app. Then you can install reactstrap and axios while developing further. Open Api for fetching data is [website](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users).

You can download and install requirements from the following links:

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/)
- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)

## Run application

 1.Clone with the repository from https://github.com/Shyamraja/UserInfoApp.git

 2.Run following command 

 ## npm install

After that Install axios,reactstrap and bootstrap. After that in the prject directory you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see if there are any errors present in the console.


## App Demo Link

You can also upload the application in netlify. I have uploaded and the live link is

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
